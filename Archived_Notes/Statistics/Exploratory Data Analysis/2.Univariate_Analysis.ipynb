    "This type of data consists of only one variable. The analysis of univariate data is thus the simplest form of analysis since the information deals with only one quantity that changes. It does not deal with causes or relationships and the main purpose of the analysis is to describe the data and find patterns that exist within it. The example of a univariate data can be height."

The description of patterns found in this type of data can be made by drawing conclusions using central tendency measures (mean, median and mode), dispersion or spread of data (range, minimum, maximum, quartiles, variance and standard deviation) and by using frequency distribution tables, histograms, pie charts, frequency polygon and bar charts."

    "## What is Univariate Analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Univariate analysis is the technique of comparing and analyzing the dependency of a single predictor and a response variable. The prefix \"uni\" means one, emphasizing the fact that the analysis only accounts for one variable's effect on a dependent variable. Univariate Analysis is thought to be one of the simplest forms of data analysis as it doesn't deal with causes or relationships, like a regression would. Primarily, Univariate Analysis simply takes data and provides a summary and associated patterns. "
