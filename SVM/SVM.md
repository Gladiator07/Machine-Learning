### Note: Read all the materials in given order for better understanding

<br>

## Introduction

<br>

- [Read this for introduction](https://towardsdatascience.com/support-vector-machine-introduction-to-machine-learning-algorithms-934a444fca47) - dont' worry much about loss function and gradient updates here, it's just an overview.
- [MachineLearningMastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/support-vector-machines-for-machine-learning/) - after finishing the above material, read this to get overview of all different things in SVM (like maximal margin classifier, soft margin classifier, kernel trick)
- [SVM Intuition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9yACitf-KM) - Krish Naik video explaining the basic intiution behind SVM
- [Maths behind SVM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js3GLb1xPhc) - Krish Naik video in continution with the above explaining the mathematics behind finding a optimal hyperplane (note this is just a basic intuition but will make things more clear further)

## Under the Hood
<br>

- [Mathematics behind SVM](https://shuzhanfan.github.io/2018/05/understanding-mathematics-behind-support-vector-machines/) - read this amazing blog post to know what actually SVMs are doing - without much of explanation and derivation

- [Part1](https://towardsdatascience.com/demystifying-maths-of-svm-13ccfe00091e) - this article derives the optimization problem for SVM
- [Part2](https://towardsdatascience.com/demystifying-maths-of-svm-part-2-30308a73e072) -  in continuation with Part-1, this explains the derivation behind the slack variable for soft margin classifier
- [Stanford CS229 Notes](https://github.com/Gladiator07/Machine-Learning-Complete/blob/master/SVM/SVM_Stanford_Notes.pdf) - notes on course taught by Andrew Ng at Stanford (CS229) - detailed explanation
