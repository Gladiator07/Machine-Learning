## Introduction
- [Read this for introduction](https://towardsdatascience.com/support-vector-machine-introduction-to-machine-learning-algorithms-934a444fca47) - dont' worry much about loss function and gradient updates here, it's just an overview.
- [MachineLearningMastery] - after finishing the above material, read this to get overview of all different things in SVM (like maximal margin classifier, soft margin classifier, kernel trick)
