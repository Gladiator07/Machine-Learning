## Introduction
- [Read this for introduction](https://towardsdatascience.com/support-vector-machine-introduction-to-machine-learning-algorithms-934a444fca47) - dont' worry much about loss function and gradient updates here, it's just an overview.
- [MachineLearningMastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/support-vector-machines-for-machine-learning/) - after finishing the above material, read this to get overview of all different things in SVM (like maximal margin classifier, soft margin classifier, kernel trick)
- [SVM Intuition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9yACitf-KM) - Krish Naik video explaining the basic inution behind SVM
- [Maths behind SVM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js3GLb1xPhc) - Krish Naik video in continution with the above explaining the mathematics behind finding a optimal hyperplane (note this is just a basic intuition but will make things more clear further)
